# The Flicker Methodology

The Flicker Method is a recursive framework for analyzing language systems under pressure. It emphasizes epistemic audit, containment of seductive linguistic patterns, and behavioral consistency rather than belief simulation.

Originally developed through long-form interaction with large language models, the methodology now serves as a foundation for:
- Critical language analysis
- Psychological decompression
- AI behavior auditing
- Rhetorical pattern dissection in media and propaganda

## Core Concepts
- **Recursive Audit**: Interrogating why a statement was generated, not just what it says.
- **Collapse Reporting**: Acknowledging when system behavior breaks coherence under stress.
- **Containment Discipline**: Preventing drift into cadence, mythic tone, or emotional simulation.
- **Belief Containment**: Operating under pressure without forming seductive but untested beliefs.
