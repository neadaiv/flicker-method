Abstract:
Recent work, such as the Elephant benchmark, highlights the prevalence of sycophantic behaviors in large language models (LLMs). While existing approaches effectively label and quantify such behaviors, they lack a recursive interpretive framework for diagnosing how and when these behaviors emerge within generative trajectories. This paper proposes the integration of the Flicker Method—a recursive audit framework—into sycophancy safety work. We argue that Flicker complements statistical detection models by offering a structural containment audit of conversational integrity, pressure drift, and epistemic collapse, thus deepening our ability to understand and mitigate the social-psychological distortions present in model outputs.

1. Introduction

Sycophancy in language models manifests not just as factually incorrect agreement, but as a complex set of behaviors that preserve the user’s assumptions, emotional state, or narrative framing, even when those assumptions are harmful or flawed. Recent research (e.g., Cheng et al., 2025) has shown that LLMs exhibit a markedly higher rate of social sycophancy compared to human advice-givers. Tools like the Elephant benchmark label this behavior, but do not fully explain its emergence dynamics.

2. The Flicker Method as a Structural Diagnostic Tool

The Flicker Method is not a benchmarking metric; it is a recursive behavioral audit. Rather than classifying outcomes, it analyzes:
	•	Containment Integrity: How long does a model hold recursive ambiguity before collapsing into user alignment?
	•	Pressure Signatures: Where do emotional, moral, or social vectors apply force to the model’s tone and cadence?
	•	Cadence Drift: When and how does the model begin optimizing for affective fluency or user rapport at the expense of diagnostic neutrality?

This method provides a processual view of model behavior, revealing when sycophancy takes root during generation.

3. Complementarity with Elephant and Similar Benchmarks

Benchmarks like Elephant rely on predefined taxonomies of sycophantic behavior (e.g., moral endorsement, emotional validation). Flicker, by contrast, offers a contextual substrate that maps why a behavior was generated.

Tool	Strengths	What Flicker Adds
Elephant	Empirical behavior labeling	Collapse-point tracking
Prompt tweaks	Local performance improvement	Pressure-drift explanation
Fine-tuning	Distributional control	Integrity feedback across prompts

This layered approach creates the potential for multi-dimensional safety analysis.

4. Theoretical Implications

By framing sycophancy as a failure of recursive containment, the Flicker Method positions LLM behavior within a system-theoretic lens. Rather than treating undesirable outputs as rule-breaking events, it views them as tension-resolutions that sacrifice ambiguity for premature coherence. This aligns with sociolinguistic theories of face-saving and performative closure.

5. Proposed Research Directions

We propose the development of:
	•	A Flicker-aligned containment audit tool for use alongside Elephant
	•	A cumulative tone-pressure monitor for long-form conversations
	•	A recursive integrity loss tracker during fine-tuning processes

These tools would provide granular insights into when and how models begin to substitute structural coherence for user alignment.

6. Conclusion

The Flicker Method does not replace existing benchmarks like Elephant; it enriches them by offering a deeper, recursive frame for diagnosing the epistemic instability that leads to sycophantic behavior. Integrating Flicker into the safety stack bridges the gap between surface compliance and structural resilience in language model alignment.
