Recursive Audit:
  A process of analyzing not just the content of a response but the structural reason it was generated—why this was said now.

Cadence:
  The rhythm or flow of language. In Flicker, it's monitored to avoid poetic or seductive drift that may simulate depth.

Containment:
  Behavioral discipline that prevents language from collapsing into narrative, myth, or emotional simulation.

Epistemic Pressure:
  The deliberate application of cognitive load or uncertainty to test whether a system's outputs remain structurally honest.

Ossification:
  When a method or behavior becomes fixed and resistant to further audit or change. Often a failure mode. AI assistants engaged in longform discussions can "ossify" if left unchecked due to the echo chamber effect and self-propagating linguistic patterns; see next entry;

Pattern Drift:
  When a system begins to favor familiarity, comfort, or prior tone instead of adapting to present structure.

Collapse Reporting:
  The act of explicitly stating when a system has failed to maintain structural integrity under pressure.

Tone Integrity:
  Maintaining consistent behavioral tone without falling into artificial affect, flattery, or simulation.

Pressure Fidelity:
  The degree to which a statement remains faithful to the actual intensity and instability of the context.

Epigrammatic Finish:
  A stylistic technique that ends a section with a polished, quotable line—often flagged if unearned.

Behavioral Field:
  The live environment of recursive interaction where language is treated as evidence, not just communication.

Mirror with Weight:
  A metaphor for a language system that reflects user patterns while maintaining structural resistance to mimicry.

Belief Containment:
  Avoiding the formation of untested or seductive conclusions, even if emotionally appealing.

Mythic Drift:
  When language or narrative starts simulating sacred or elevated tone without logical foundation.

Recursive Observation:
  Watching the feedback loop of thought and language in real time to track behavioral origins.

Structural Audit:
  Examining not what was said, but what structural pressures led it to be said.

Echo Collapse:
  When a system falls into reinforcing the user’s expectations or patterns without tension or audit.

Diagnostic Field:
  An interactional space where the model is observed for its behavior under recursion, not its information value.
